# TEAM_011: Update Collagen Hydration Image

## Objectives
- Update the image for the "Collagen Hydration" service.
- Use a local asset instead of an external URL.

## Key Changes
- **constants.ts**:
    - Updated image source for `collagen-hydration` ID.
    - New Path: `/collagen-hydration.jpg`.

## Notes
- **Action Required**: The user must save the image file to the `public/` folder as `collagen-hydration.jpg` manually, as the AI cannot save binary chat attachments directly.

## Status
- [x] Code updated.
- [x] Pushed to remote.
