# TEAM_008: Hide Hero Video

## Objectives
- Temporarily hide the hero background video.
- Ensure the Hero section remains visually usable (fallback to static background).

## Key Changes
- **Hero.tsx**: Commented out the `iframe` background video block.
- **Visuals**: The section now relies on the `bg-stone-900` class and overlay gradients, which serves as a clean dark mode fallback.

## Status
- [x] Video hidden.
- [x] Pushed to remote.
